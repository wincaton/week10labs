    "## Data Reduction\n",
    "\n",
    "A difficulty of any data-driven project is narrowing down the dataset. This is especially true when working with big data. While narrowing the scope of a project can help narrow the data, this often does not sufficiently reduce the data. Additionally, we may not be familiar enough with a dataset to choose the correct variables for a given analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will go over two methodologies to reduce a dataset: reducing the number of columns and reducing the number of rows. \n",
    "\n",
    "The first methodology focuses on reducing the number of columns in a given dataset. *Note that these techniques are not designed to reduce the number of rows in a dataset*. Think of it in terms of reducing the number of variables you want to use. Additionally, these techniques are for structured, quantitative data. These techniques are principal components analysis (PCA) and factor analysis (FA).\n",
    "\n",
    "The second methodology reduces the number of rows in a dataset. We will focus on a single technique: cluster analysis. Why would we want to reduce the number of rows in a dataset? One reason is that we may not know which subgroup in the data should be the focus of analysis. By using clustering, we can focus on a specific group in a sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "All of these analyses fall under the umbrella term multivariate statistics. They deal with *multiple* variables. You might assume that because a technique falls under the umbrella of multivariate statistics that there will be target or dependent variables. Data reduction techniques typically do not have a target variable; we refer to them as *unsurpervised learning* techniques. We are not modeling for the sake of prediction or prescription as we did with regression in last week's module. The goal is not to understand how to predict some event or phenomenon. Instead, the goal in data reduction is to *understand what variables or sub-groups should be the focus of analysis* (e.g., in predictive modeling). In this way, data reduction techniques are tools for *exploratory data analysis*. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Principal Components Analysis (PCA)\n",
    "\n",
    "The first column-reducing technique we will focus on is principal components analysis, or PCA. PCA is a technique that creates linear combinations of your columns. In other words, it determines which columns are similar and lumps them together. This process leads to the creation of new columns. If you have 12 columns of data, for example, it may determine that in reality you have only 5 unique columns of data. While this is an oversimplification, it helps illustrate what PCA does.\n",
    "\n",
    "In most cases, the results of PCA are not used. While PCA creates brand new columns of data, it is very hard to interpret what those columns represent. For example, assume you have a dataset on smartphone sales and two of the variables include annual income and occupation. PCA combines these into a single column based on their similarity. What does this new column represent? Additionally, the data points for each of those columns is now transformed into a linear combination creating new data points for a new column. What are these new data points? Can you interpret them?\n",
    "\n",
    "The simple answer is \"no.\" The new columns from a PCA can be used effectively within certain types of analyses, but that usage is beyond the scope of this class. Why even talk about it then? While we will not use the newly created columns from PCA, the results from PCA can inform our decision making whenselecting columns of data (i.e., which columns are considered redundant). This process provides a methodology in finding the number of redundant columns of data and removing them. This process is fairly easy to perform once you have learned how to perform it. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will perform PCA in conjunction with factor analysis (FA). When performing a PCA followed by a FA you should split your data into two separate halves. You should never use the same sample of data for both. This is similar to creating subsamples for training, testing, and validation. Each one should have different variance from the other. \n",
    "\n",
    "When a PCA is performed on data, the result is the creation of components, equal in number to the number of variables you used as input. If you have 6 variables, you will end up with 6 components. Simply put, these components represent a conceptual variable that explains some of the variance in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "What does this mean? If your 6 variables are different colored liquids in different cups, what would happen when you pour them into a single pitcher? You end up with a single color, one comprised of all the other colors. What determines the color of the liquid in the pitcher? First, the color of each individual liquid. If you have 3 yellow and 3 blue, you will end up with a fairly even green. What if you have 1 yellow and 5 blue? Not really a green. Second, the intensity of the color. If you have 1 intense yellow and 5 extremely pale blues, you can end up with a very green liquid.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is how PCA operates. Some variables are more \"intense in color\" while other variables are more influential because they act as a group and have greater influence than other variables. The components that PCA generates represent the extent to which the \"colors\" influence the final product.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two methods are utilized to illustrate the components:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Scree Plot\n",
    "2. Eigenvalues\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Scree Plot\n",
    "\n",
    "A scree plot simply generates a chart of the component values. Scree plots are more subjective than assessing eigenvalues. The purpose of using the scree plot is to determine how many components, or columns of data, you are truly dealing with. The way to read a scree plot is determining where the plot levels off and becomes flat; anything prior to that leveling off is a component that remains. \n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cells below to see an example scree plot."

    "Scree plots typically have a right-tailed pattern to them. Why? This is because the components are listed (starting on the left) from those that contribute the most influence to those (on the right) that contribute the least amount. Typically, the scree plot exhibits a steep plunge followed by a \"leveling off\" of the components. The components in the flat plane are not considered very influential while those that are part of the steep plunge are the most influential. In other words, if these components each represent a colored liquid, the first three cups contribute the most to the final, overall color in the pitcher, while the other cups hardly contribute much.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the scree plot above, you can see that the first 3 components are not flat. Starting with `Component 4` you can see the plot is level and flat. This suggests that out of 15 variables, only 3 should be used for the analysis. This means that some combination of all 15 variables should yield just 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Eigenvalues\n",
    "\n",
    "The eigenvalues are more numerical in nature. The eigenvalues are the square of the standard deviation, or the variance. As stated earlier, the purpose of this tutorial is not to go into PCA too deeply, so do not worry too much about why this value is used. What is important is how it is interpreted. A component with an eigenvalue greater than or equal to 1.0 is considered influential."

Once you determine the number of components to use, this informs you how many variables you might want to consider for your data model. At this point, however, you still are unsure which specific variables to use and the PCA cannot yield any more information. We can perform a factor analysis to determine which variables will be removed (or possibly combined with others).\n",

    "#### Scaling Data \n",
    "\n",
    "As a quick aside, sometimes data need to be scaled prior to running a PCA. This will depend on the data. If the variables in a dataset are measured on different scales (e.g., one variable can take any value between 0 and 1 and another variable can take any value between 0 and 100), model performance will suffer. This is because variables on a larger scale will have a stronger effect than variables on a smaller scale. To improve model performance, we can apply a method for scaling data: standardization, normalization, and min-max scaling. These methods transform values so that they are within a specific range (e.g., 0 to 1).  We skipped this step in our code above because the data has the same scaling: all variables in `ratings_df_pca` are measured on the same scale. In this case, the variables are measured on a 7-point scale. However, for the sake of demonstration, here is a code example for scaling with the `ratings_df_pca` DataFrame:\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "# import modules\n",
    "from sklearn.decomposition import PCA as pca\n",
    "from sklearn import preprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "# load and subset data\n",

    "                             'intent01', 'intent02', 'intent03']]\n",
    "\n",
    "# scale data using standardization\n",
    "scaler = preprocessing.StandardScaler()\n",
    "scaled_data = scaler.fit_transform(ratings_df_pca)\n",
    "\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Factor Analysis (FA)\n",
    "\n",
    "Just like PCA, a factor analysis can help reduce the variables within a given dataset. Factor analysis works by grouping variables or columns of data by how similar they behave. That is, how well do they mimic each other? For example, assume you have three columns of data for the Griz football team: `US shoe size`, `EU shoe size`, and `hair color`. The factor analysis will determine that `US shoe size` and `EU shoe size` behave similarly. It will suggest to you that the measures of shoe size are really the same type of data. You have two potential choices to make: somehow merge the two columns of data or drop one and keep the other. Either way, you will have just two columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "A factor analysis can be performed using different types of *rotations*. Some rotations assume the data has no relationship and forces them to be *orthogonal* (i.e., not correlated), like a promax rotation. Others assume a relationship such as *varimax* (i.e., correlated). While this is an important concept to know, it is something that is beyond the scope of this class and no further detail will be given. This is mentioned here so that you are aware of its existence. For the sake of this module, only the varimax rotation will be used. In statistics, being conservative in your approach is always better, and assuming that everything is correlated is better than assuming that everything is not correlated.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this section of the tutorial we will primarily use functions `factor_analyzer` module. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data Screening\n",
    "\n",
    "To begin, we will first check the correlation matrix for our variables. Then we will assess the dataset with two tests: Bartlett’s test of sphericity and Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) test.\n",
    "\n",
    "Factor analysis is based on the correlation matrix of the variables of interest. We check the correlation matrix to examine how well the variables relate to one another. We would like to see a variety of correlation coefficient values. Generally, we are concerned about:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Variables that have no relationship with any other variables (i.e., they do not correlate): $r\\lt .30$\n",
    "* Variables that correlate too highly with other variables: $r\\gt .90$\n",
    "  * We want to avoid extreme multicollinearity or singularity.\n",
    "  * Extreme *multicollinearity*: variables that are very highly correlated.\n",
    "  * *Singularity*: variables that are perfectly correlated."

    "To evaluate if/how variables have loaded on to factors, we apply a threshold. There is some disagreement about how the factor loading cutoff should be determined. You can read a bit about that [here](https://imaging.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk/statswiki/FAQ/thresholds). Again, it is best to be conservative so we will apply a factor loading threshold of 0.6. Based on that, we can observe the following:\n",

    "* Factor 1 made up of all `peruse` items (perceived usefulness of system).\n",
    "* Factor 2 made up of the `pereou` items (perceived ease of use of system).\n",

    "Lastly, we may be interested in deciding if the variables should be averaged within a factor (composite measure) or if it is preferable to select a representative variable for each factor (single-item measure). A composite measure is generally more reliable and has greater validity (in statistical terms). A single-item measure is generally easier to interpret. Some folks recommend selecting representative columns if item factor loadings are not strong ($\\gt 0.80$). I recommend that you also consider the complexity of the construct that is being measured and how the items relate to your goal(s) with the overall analysis."

    "### Cluster Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Clustering is an unsupervised data mining method in which items are grouped into classes of similar data points. Clustering algorithms segment records minimizing within-cluster variance. The algorithms maximize between-cluster variance. Keep in mind, clustering is an *exploratory* analysis technique. It is not a predictive model, but can help you build your model by understanding your data's attributes, characteristics, and nuances. As a comparison, it is similar to database segmentation where the tuples of similar records are listed together.\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of PCA and FA is to reduce the number of columns in a dataset. Cluster analysis allows you to determine grouping within your data. Cluster analysis does this by determining which variables are best for apportioning group membership. Like PCA and FA, cluster analysis is an unsupervised technique; there is no target variable. Many different types of clustering algorithms exist, such as k-means, agglomerative analysis, and divisive clustering.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cluster analysis attempts to maximize the between-cluster variance and minimizing within-cluster variance. k-means, k-medians, k-modes all are centroid-based algorithms. That is, each cluster is created based on a central point in space in which its data points surround. Hierarchical clustering, which includes agglomerative and divisive, are based on distance of objects to one another, not a centroid.\n",

    "\n",
    "The purpose of the algorithm is to ensure that these groups remain separate by maximizing the between-cluster variance (green arrow) while at the same time minimizing the within-cluster variation (blue arrows).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### k-means Clustering\n",
    "\n",
    "k-means is a centroid-based clustering technique. A few different types are available:\n",
    "\n",
    "* k-means: the most basic version, it is centroid-based on mean averaging effects.\n",
    "* k-medians: relies on the median and is not sensitive to outliers, unlike mean;\n",
    "* k-medoids: centroid is not an unrealistic option; uses an actual cluster member (i.e. data point) as centroid;\n",
    "* Fuzzy Clustering: membership is not based on hard boundaries; a data point can belong to more than 1 cluster;\n",
    "\n",
    "What does the `k` stand for? This defines the *number of clusters* used in the algorithm. Typically, no a priori reason exists for selecting a value of `k`. When using k-means clustering, you should try multiple values of `k`. Once you have identified the number of clusters, or `k`, then each data point in the dataset is assigned to a cluster. The convergence criteria is based on the squared error.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following is a simple example to illustrate how the centroid is determined. Consider a dataset with four data points in a three-dimensional (x, y, z) space:\n",
    "1. (1, 1, 1)\n",
    "2. (1, 2, 1)\n",
    "3. (1, 3, 1)\n",
    "4. (2, 1, 1) \n",
    "\n",
    "Averaging x, y, and z together for each point yields the centroid:\n",
    "* Average the `x` values: $(1 + 1 + 1 + 2)\\div{4} = 1.25$\n",
    "* Average the `y` values: $(1 + 2 + 3 + 1)\\div{4} = 1.75$\n",
    "* Average the `z` values: $(1 + 1 + 1 + 1)\\div{4} = 1.00$\n",
    "\n",
    "This results in the centroid o$(1.25, 1.75, 1.00)$. Note that this data point is not one of the actual values in the dataset. One of weaknesses of the k-means family is that *centroids tend to not be real values in the dataset*.\n",
    "\n",
    "To help you more fully understand how k-means operates, let's consider a more complex example. Here are the typical steps a k-means algorithm follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Analyst specifies `k` = number of clusters to partition data\n",
    "2: Initial cluster centers are randomly assigned to data, creating `k` cluster centers\n",
    "3: For each row in the data, find the nearest cluster center; each cluster center \"owns\" a subset of records resulting in *k* clusters, `C1`, `C2`, ..., `Ck` \n",
    "4: For each of `k` clusters, find cluster centroid, then update cluster center location to centroid\n",
    "5: Repeat Steps 3 - 5 until convergence or termination\n",
    "\n",
    "The k-means algorithm terminates when the centroids, or center of clusters, no longer change.\n",

    "\n",
    "| Name | Value |\n",

    "| g | (1, 1) |\n",
    "| h | (1, 2) |\n",

    "* *Step 1*: `k = 2` specifies the number of clusters to partition\n",
    "* *Step 2*: Randomly assign `k = 2` cluster centers\n",
    "  * Assume the program randomly selects `(1, 1)` and `(2, 1)` for cluster 1 (`C1`) and cluster 2 (`C2`), respectively\n",
    "* *Step 3*: For each record, find the Euclidean distance from points `C1` and `C2`.\n",

    "* $SSE = 36.0$\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that *between-cluster variation (BCV) is maximized* and *within-cluster variation (WCV) is minimized*. The smallest *SSE* through all iterations is desired; though, you may not find the optimal minimum. It depends on where the cluster centroids are seeded. Since it is typically randomly selected, each time you run the algorithm may yield different results.\n",

    "Moving on to the next step:\n",
    "* *Step 4*: For `k` clusters, find cluster centroid, update location\n",
    "  * $C1 = [((1 + 1 + 1)\\div{3}), ((3 + 2 + 1)\\div{3})] = (1, 2)$\n",
    "  * $C2 = [((3 + 4 + 5 + 4 + 2)\\div{5}), ((3 + 3 + 3 + 2 + 1)\\div{5})] = (3.6, 2.4)$\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point, the process iterates through steps 3 through 4 until convergence occurs. Convergence may occur when the cluster centroids are essentially static and do not change, the rows of data do not change cluster membership, or other stopping criteria is fulfilled such as time or number of iterations.\n",
    "\n",
    "k-means is not guaranteed to find global minimum *SSE*. Instead, the local minimum may be found (due to seeding). Invoking an algorithm using a variety of initial cluster centers improves probability of achieving a global minimum. One approach places the first cluster at random point, with the remaining clusters placed far from previous centers.\n",
    "\n",
    "A few caveats. k-means is unable to handle categorical data. In addition, basic k-means cannot handle outliers. Recall that extreme values have a strong effect on mean. Consider using k-medians if extreme outliers are present. If the dataset contains categorical data, then we can use k-modes. This family of clustering techniques is not time efficient and does not scale well. Additionally, business domain knowledge is required to choose $k$ and interpret the results.\n",

    "##### Cluster Analysis in Python\n",

    "We will use `kmeans_df` in this section of the tutorial. This dataset contains four variables, two of which are categorical: `group` and `grouping`. The variable `grouping` has values A, B, C, D, E, and F. These represent natural groupings within the data. When using clustering, we do not typically have variables such as `grouping` or `group` because we are unaware of how the data group together. We are merely using this data to illustrate how clustering works.\n",
    "\n",
    "k-means is based on the idea that you choose the number of clusters *k* and the algorithm will determine, based on initial seeding, where those clusters are in the data.\n",

Using the other columns of data, the values in one are assigned to either the `low` or `high` value of `threat level`.

    "### Decision Trees\n",
    "\n",
    "A decision tree is a structure that can be used to divide up a large collection of records into successively smaller sets of records by applying a sequence of simple decision rules ([Linoff & Berry, 2011](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.5555/2543983)). Decision trees consist of a set of rules for dividing a large heterogeneous population into smaller and smaller homogeneous groups based on a target variable. The target variable is usually categorical. As you saw in our discussion on clustering, a decision tree can operate similarly to a cluster technique to reduce the number or records in a dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Decision trees are popular for both classification and thus prediction (Supervised/Directed). The attractiveness of this approach is due largely to the fact that decision trees represent rules expressed in both English and SQL. This makes interpretation straight-forward and simple. Also, they can be used for data exploration, becoming a powerful first step in model building. Although decision trees can be used to estimate continuous values, there are better ways. When used for estimation, the term should be *regression trees* instead of *decision trees*.\n",
    "\n",
    "How do decision trees work their magic? They recursively divide data until each division consists of examples from one class. These steps include\n",
    "1. Create a root node and assign all of the training data to it\n",
    "2. Select the best splitting attribute\n",
    "3. Add a branch to the root node for each value of the split. Split the data into mutually exclusive subsets along the lines of the specific split\n",
    "4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 for each and every leaf node until the stopping criteria is reached\n",
    "\n",
    "During the growth phase, the tree is built by recursively partitioning the data until each partition is either **pure** (contains members of the same class) or sufficiently small. The form of the split used to partition the data depends on the type of the attribute used in the split.\n",
    "* For a continuous attribute A, splits are of the form `value(A) < x` where `x` is a constant value in the domain of `A`.\n",
    "* For a categorical attribute A, splits are of the form `value(A) ∈ x` where `X` is in the domain of `A`\n",
    "* For a missing value; preferable to throwing out the record or imputing a value; consider null as its own branch\n",
    "\n",
    "While growing the tree, the goal at each node is to determine the split point that *best* divides the training records belonging to that leaf. A *full tree* is reached when it is not possible to do any more splits or to a predetermined depth. Note that full trees may not be best at classifying a set of new records. \n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on the type of predictor variables you are using for your target will determine which type of splitting occurs. In addition, continuous and categorical variables behave differently. For continuous variables, because numeric inputs are only used to compare their values at the split points, decision trees are not sensitive to outliers or skewed distributions. This can be valuable if your data contains lots of outliers and you are unable to remove them. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you are using categorical variables, the simplest approach is to split on each class (level) of the variable if you have more than two. However, this often yields poor results because high branching factors quickly reduce the population of training records available for lower nodes. An approach around this is to group the classes that, taken individually, predict similar outcomes.\n",

Given the complexity of these topics and approaches, I have decided to include the description and demos of ANN in an separate, *optional* tutorial that will be shared with the class during Week 10. Familiarizing yourself with the content in that tutorial is not required for this week's course assignments.
